# CoNLL-to-SSF
This creates HUTB corpus given in CoNLL fromat to SSF format.
Please note that I have used python 3.5.2 and NLTK 3.3 for the conversion.

In the folder, there is a program with the name CoNLL2SSF.py. On executing, it creates two files- file1.txt and output.txt. 
file1.txt is an intermediate file which gets cleared on its own at the end of program execution. 
output.txt file contains the data in inter-chunk SSF format.

Sample input and sample output files are also given.
